                  Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, and the second
                  largest planet in the Solar System like fellow gas giant
                  Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and
                  helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none
                  are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's.

                  The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human
                  eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is
                  named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was
                  also the father of Jupiter.He is the equivalent of the Greek
                  god Kronos, who was the father of Zeus. The astronomical sign
                  for Saturn is <span>♄</span>.

                  Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids,
                  or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the
                  planet, torn apart by Saturn's powerful gravity. They are made
                  of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with other
                  materials such as dust. The ring particles mostly range from
                  tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house. A few
                  particles are as large as mountains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Saturn's ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000
                  kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is
                  typically about 10 meters in the main rings. Named
                  alphabetically in the order they were discovered, the rings
                  are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a
                  gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called
                  the Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B. The main
                  rings are A, B, and C. Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and
                  more recently discovered.

                  <h3>Enceladus</h3>
                  <p>
                    Few worlds in our solar system are as compelling as
                    Enceladus. A handful of worlds are thought to have liquid
                    water oceans beneath their frozen shell, but Enceladus
                    sprays its ocean out into space where spacecraft can sample
                    it. From these samples, scientists have determined that
                    Enceladus has most of the chemical ingredients needed for
                    life, and likely has hydrothermal vents releasing hot,
                    mineral-rich water into its ocean. Pictures from the Voyager
                    spacecraft in the 1980s indicated that although this moon is
                    small—only about 310 miles (500 kilometers) across — its icy
                    surface is remarkably smooth in some places, and bright
                    white all over. In fact, Enceladus is the most reflective
                    body in the solar system. Enceladus orbits Saturn at a
                    distance of 148,000 miles (238,000 kilometers) between the
                    orbits of two other moons, Mimas and Tethys. Enceladus is
                    tidally locked with Saturn, keeping the same face toward the
                    planet. It completes one orbit every 32.9 hours within the
                    densest part of Saturn's E Ring. The water jets come from
                    relatively warm fractures in the crust, which scientists
                    informally call the “tiger stripes.” Several gases,
                    including water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, perhaps a
                    little ammonia and either carbon monoxide or nitrogen gas
                    make up the gaseous envelope of the plume, along with salts
                    and silica. And the density of organic materials in the
                    plume was about 20 times denser than scientists expected.
                    With its global ocean, unique chemistry and internal heat,
                    Enceladus has become a promising lead in our search for
                    worlds where life could exist.

                  <h3>Tethys</h3>
                  <p>
                    Tethys is Saturn's fifth largest moon. Tethys has
                    gravitationally locked two smaller moons into its own
                    subsystem — Telesto and Calypso. These three moons complete
                    their orbits around Saturn moving as a unit, spaced out at
                    60-degree intervals first Telesto, then Tethys, followed by
                    Calypso. The Tethyan northern hemisphere is lighter colored
                    and heavily reworked from ages of bombardment. Closer to the
                    equator, the terrain is darker and has fewer craters. This
                    less-dense cratering suggests past internal activity and
                    resurfacing of the terrain. Around the equator on its
                    leading side, Tethys wears a band of slightly darker surface
                    material. Scientists suspect the darkened region may
                    represent an area of less contaminated ice with differently
                    sized grains than the material at higher latitudes on either
                    side of the band.

                <p>
                  Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed
                  about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas
                  and dust in to become this gas giant. About 4 billion years
                  ago, Saturn settled into its current position in the outer
                  solar system, where it is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like
                  Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the
                  same two main components that make up the Sun.

                <h3>Orbit and Rotation</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One
                  day on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours (the time it takes for
                  Saturn to rotate or spin around once), and Saturn makes a
                  complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Saturnian time) in
                  about 29.4 Earth years (10,756 Earth days).

                <p>
                  As a gas giant, Saturn doesn`t have a true surface. The planet
                  is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a
                  spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn`t
                  be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures
                  and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and
                  vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.

                <br />
                <p>
                  With an equatorial diameter of about 74,897 miles (120,500
                  kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth. If Earth were
                  the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a
                  volleyball. From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4
                  billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units away
                  from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is
                  the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it
                  takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn.

                  of the satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous
                  magnetosphere, the region of space in which the behavior of
                  electrically charged particles is influenced more by Saturn's
                  magnetic field than by the solar wind. Aurorae occur when
                  charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along
                  magnetic field lines. On Earth, these charged particles come
                  from the solar wind. Cassini showed that at least some of
                  Saturn's aurorae are like Jupiter's and are largely unaffected
                  by the solar wind. Instead, these aurorae are caused by a
                  combination of particles ejected from Saturn's moons and
                  Saturn's magnetic field's rapid rotation rate. But these
                  "non-solar-originating" aurorae are not completely understood
                  yet.

                <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes,
                  jet streams, and storms. The planet is many different shades
                  of yellow, brown, and gray. Winds in the upper atmosphere
                  reach 500 meters per second in the equatorial region. In
                  contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out
                  at about 110 meters per second. And the pressure - the same
                  kind you feel when you dive deep underwater - is so powerful
                  it squeezes gas into a liquid. Saturn's north pole has an
                  interesting atmospheric feature - a six-sided jet stream. This
                  hexagon-shaped pattern was first noticed in images from the
                  Voyager I spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the
                  Cassini spacecraft since. Saturn's north pole has an

                  across, the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of about 322
                  kilometers per hour with a massive, rotating storm at the
                  center. There is no weather feature like it anywhere else in
                  the solar system.

                <h3>Potential for Life</h3>
                <p>
                  Saturn is considered uninhabitable for life as we know it. The
                  temperature and pressure on the planet are likely too extreme
                  for life forms to thrive there. The moons Titan and Enceladus,
                  on the other hand, may have conditions that are conducive to
                  the existence of life forms there.

                <p>Saturn Has Been Explored By Four Spacecraft.</p>
                <p>
                  <span>Cassini-Huygens (1997-2017):</span> A collaborative
                  mission between NASA and the European Space Agency, Cassini
                  orbited Saturn for 13 years, delivering over 450,000 images
                  and invaluable data. It deployed the Huygens probe, which
                  achieved the first landing on Titan, providing unprecedented
                  insights into its surface and atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>Voyager 1 and 2 (1977):</span> These spacecraft
                  conducted flybys of Saturn, capturing high-resolution images
                  and revealing complex ring structures and numerous moons,
                  fundamentally altering our understanding of the Saturnian
                  system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>Pioneer 11 (1973):</span> As the first spacecraft to
                  encounter Saturn, Pioneer 11 provided the initial close-up
                  images and data, laying the groundwork for subsequent
                  missions.
