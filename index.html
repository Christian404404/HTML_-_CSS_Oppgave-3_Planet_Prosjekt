              <p>
                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, and the second largest
                planet in the Solar System like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn
                is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is
                not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular
                or as complex as Saturn's.

                The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human
                eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is
                named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also
                the father of Jupiter.He is the equivalent of the Greek god
                Kronos, who was the father of Zeus. The astronomical sign for
                Saturn is <span>â™„</span>.

        <p>
          Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or
          shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, torn
          apart by Saturn's powerful gravity. They are made of billions of small
          chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials such as dust. The
          ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks
          as big as a house. A few particles are as large as mountains. Saturn's
          ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the
          planet, yet the vertical height is typically about 10 meters in the
          main rings. Named alphabetically in the order they were discovered,
          the rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a
          gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called the
          Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B. The main rings are A,
          B, and C. Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and more recently
          discovered.

              <h3>Formation</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about
                4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust
                in to become this gas giant. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn
                settled into its current position in the outer solar system,
                where it is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn
                is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main
                components that make up the Sun.

              <h3>Orbit and Rotation</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day
                on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours (the time it takes for Saturn to
                rotate or spin around once), and Saturn makes a complete orbit
                around the Sun (a year in Saturnian time) in about 29.4 Earth
                years (10,756 Earth days).

              <h3>Surface</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                As a gas giant, Saturn doesn`t have a true surface. The planet
                is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a
                spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn`t be
                able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and
                temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and
                vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.

              <h3>Size and Distance</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                With an equatorial diameter of about 74,897 miles (120,500
                kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth. If Earth were
                the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a
                volleyball. From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4
                billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units away from
                the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the
                distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes
                sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn.

              <h3>Magnetosphere</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578
                times as powerful as Earth's. Saturn, the rings, and many of the
                satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous magnetosphere,
                the region of space in which the behavior of electrically
                charged particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field
                than by the solar wind. Aurorae occur when charged particles
                spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines. On
                Earth, these charged particles come from the solar wind. Cassini
                showed that at least some of Saturn's aurorae are like Jupiter's
                and are largely unaffected by the solar wind. Instead, these
                aurorae are caused by a combination of particles ejected from
                Saturn's moons and Saturn's magnetic field's rapid rotation
                rate. But these "non-solar-originating" aurorae are not
                completely understood yet.

                Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes,
                jet streams, and storms. The planet is many different shades of
                yellow, brown, and gray. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500
                meters per second in the equatorial region. In contrast, the
                strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 110
                meters per second. And the pressure - the same kind you feel
                when you dive deep underwater - is so powerful it squeezes gas
                into a liquid. Saturn's north pole has an interesting
                atmospheric feature - a six-sided jet stream. This
                hexagon-shaped pattern was first noticed in images from the
                Voyager I spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the
                Cassini spacecraft since. Saturn's north pole has an interesting

                across, the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of about 322 kilometers
                per hour with a massive, rotating storm at the center. There is
                no weather feature like it anywhere else in the solar system.

                Saturn is considered uninhabitable for life as we know it. The
                temperature and pressure on the planet are likely too extreme
                for life forms to thrive there. The moons Titan and Enceladus,
                on the other hand, may have conditions that are conducive to the
                existence of life forms there.
