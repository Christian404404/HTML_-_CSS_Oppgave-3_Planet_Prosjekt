              <h3>Magnetosphere</h3>
              <p>
                Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578
                times as powerful as Earth's. Saturn, the rings, and many of the
                satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous magnetosphere,
                the region of space in which the behavior of electrically
                charged particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field
                than by the solar wind. Aurorae occur when charged particles
                spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines. On
                Earth, these charged particles come from the solar wind. Cassini
                showed that at least some of Saturn's aurorae are like Jupiter's
                and are largely unaffected by the solar wind. Instead, these
                aurorae are caused by a combination of particles ejected from
                Saturn's moons and Saturn's magnetic field's rapid rotation
                rate. But these "non-solar-originating" aurorae are not
                completely understood yet.

              <p>
                Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes,
                jet streams, and storms. The planet is many different shades of
                yellow, brown, and gray. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500
                meters per second in the equatorial region. In contrast, the
                strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 110
                meters per second. And the pressure - the same kind you feel
                when you dive deep underwater - is so powerful it squeezes gas
                into a liquid. Saturn's north pole has an interesting
                atmospheric feature - a six-sided jet stream. This
                hexagon-shaped pattern was first noticed in images from the
                Voyager I spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the
                Cassini spacecraft since. Saturn's north pole has an interesting

                Cassini spacecraft since. Spanning about 30,000 kilometers
                across, the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of about 322 kilometers
                per hour with a massive, rotating storm at the center. There is
                no weather feature like it anywhere else in the solar system.
