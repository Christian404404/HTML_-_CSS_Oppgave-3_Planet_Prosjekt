          <h3>Formation</h3>
          <p>
            Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5
            billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to
            become this gas giant. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled
            into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the
            sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of
            hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the
            Sun.

          <h3>Surface</h3>
          <p>
            As a gas giant, Saturn doesn`t have a true surface. The planet is
            mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a spacecraft
            would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn`t be able to fly
            through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures
            deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and vaporize any
            spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.

          <h3>Size and Distance</h3>
          <p>
            With an equatorial diameter of about 74,897 miles (120,500
            kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the
            size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a volleyball. From
            an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers),
            Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical
            unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.
            From this distance, it takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the
            Sun to Saturn.

          <h3>Orbit and Rotation</h3>
          <p>
            Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on
            Saturn takes only 10.7 hours (the time it takes for Saturn to rotate
            or spin around once), and Saturn makes a complete orbit around the
            Sun (a year in Saturnian time) in about 29.4 Earth years (10,756
            Earth days).

          <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
          <p>
            Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet
            streams, and storms. The planet is many different shades of yellow,
            brown, and gray. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters per
            second in the equatorial region. In contrast, the strongest
            hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 110 meters per
            second. And the pressure - the same kind you feel when you dive deep
            underwater - is so powerful it squeezes gas into a liquid. Saturn's
            north pole has an interesting atmospheric feature â€“ a six-sided jet
            stream. This hexagon-shaped pattern was first noticed in images from
            the Voyager I spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the
            Cassini spacecraft since

          <h3>Magnetosphere</h3>
          <p>
            Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578
            times as powerful as Earth's. Saturn, the rings, and many of the
            satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous magnetosphere, the
            region of space in which the behavior of electrically charged
            particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field than by the
            solar wind. Aurorae occur when charged particles spiral into a
            planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines. On Earth, these
            charged particles come from the solar wind. Cassini showed that at
            least some of Saturn's aurorae are like Jupiter's and are largely
            unaffected by the solar wind. Instead, these aurorae are caused by a
            combination of particles ejected from Saturn's moons and Saturn's
            magnetic field's rapid rotation rate. But these
            "non-solar-originating" aurorae are not completely understood yet.
